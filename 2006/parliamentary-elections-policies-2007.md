## Vihre√§t - The Greens


Parliamentary elections 2007


# Parliamentary elections policies 2007


Approved by Party Council 17th September 2006


## Green is for courage, responsibility and justice


Green policies are about **courage**. They offer solutions to the biggest
problems of our time: climate change, increasing inequality and an unpredictable
working life.


Green policies are about **responsibility**. They span over election years and
state borders. The decisions we make must be decisions that we can share with
our grandchildren with pride.


Green policies are about **justice**. They combine protecting our society's
weak, conserving nature and respecting diversity. We advance the interests of
those who cannot get their voice heard: the future generations, the nature, the
poor of our country and the world. The equilibrium between nature and man also
guarantees a secure future.


### Quality of Life from Services, Education and Culture


*Every human being is valuable. Civilized society respects diversity and
especially looks after the weak. Everybody has a right to a living guaranteeing
humane life. The fairness of our welfare state is shown in everyday life as good
public services. Education and culture belong to everyone.*


#### Fruits of growth belong to everyone


A part of the population is doing economically better than ever. However, the
fruits of economic growth are not available to everyone. Those depending on
social security for their living are faring especially poorly.


The government of Finland has used most of its economical leeway for giving tax
cuts for people with high incomes, and has not been able to afford income
transfers. The number of poor people in Finland has doubled up during the last
10 years. The poor, numbering half a million, consist of pensioners, students
and the long-term unemployed and of people in the general workforce.


#### Child allowances, maintenance allowances and parental allowances must be increased


Comparatively, poverty in families with children has increased the most.
Families in worst situations are single parent families and families with
numerous children. The distinctions between well-off and poor start to develop
early in life, and every fifth child is in danger of being marginalized. Finland
is developing a class society for children. To prevent this, benefits to poor
families with children must be increased quickly. In addition to this, diverse
families must be treated equally; all-male couples and allfemale couples must be
guaranteed their right to adopt and marry.


#### A more just pension system


Finns are ageing. It is usually seen as a negative trend, but an ageing
population can also be a resource. It requires, however, that the basic living
of pensioners is secured and that the public services support their well-being
and health. Previously, those raising children at home did not accrue a pension
and women's wage levels have been lower than men's. Due to this, the average
pension for a woman has only been two thirds of the average pension for men.
Small pensions must be increased and pension security of women must be improved.


#### High quality of public services must be maintained


Taxes must not be cut at the expense of public services. Public services of high
quality are advantageous to all, particularly the weak. The most vulnerable in
our society are those outside working life: the elderly, the children, the sick,
the mentally ill, the seriously disabled and the long-term unemployed. The
services facilitating the quality of life for these groups must be improved,
instead of constantly reducing them in order to cut costs. The independent lives
of disabled people and the everyday lives of rehabilitating mental patients are
only enabled by special support by municipality or state. Cases of mental
problems are increasing constantly, even with children and the young. Therefore
it is essential that the financing of mental care services is secured.


The securing of services is not only just, it is also economical. It is cheaper
to prevent problems than to solve them afterwards. In future we must be able to
provide humane care to a growing number of the elderly. By emphasizing
pre-emptive exercises and independent living by providing home care for the
elderly, we improve their quality of life and reduce social and health care
costs. By securing the living and well-being at work for family care givers, we
can minimize the need for expensive institutional care. The elderly in
institutional care must be provided with skilled and trained nursing staff.


Despite the general improvement in national health, the health differences
between different age groups have not diminished. The Greens want to face this
challenge with resolve. The central points in the solution are prevention of
poverty and marginalization, early intervention (i.e. child welfare clinics and
school healthcare) and an environment which promotes the maintaining of one's
own physical, social and mental health.


#### Some services cannot be priced


The main responsibility for providing basic services falls to municipalities -
and it should continue to do so. The state cannot leave the municipalities to
fare on their own; rather it must secure sufficient funding for welfare
services. Certain services cannot be made into businesses or outsourced. For
example, library services cannot be made into a business of merely borrowing
books; libraries are also for reading magazines, meeting people and using the
Internet. Not all things have a price.


All municipalities are buying services. In these situations they must have the
wisdom to asses what services to buy and how to buy them - and where to buy
them. For example the child protection organizations have unparalleled expertise
in producing services in their own field. When putting services out to tender
the municipalities must be allowed to choose whether they will acquire the
services they need from non-profit organizations or from businesses.


Most of the power invested in municipal councils, has slipped away to a complex
group of cooperative municipal organizations. A better alternative is to
transfer, for example, heath care decision making to provincial level and to
elect provincial councils in direct elections. Power and responsibility must go
hand in hand.


#### Culture is part of basic services


For the Greens, living culture has an intrinsic value as well as offering a
means to achieving good living standards. Culture must be a part of every day
life and belong to basic services. Through culture we give birth to a creative
society. A supply of living culture has become one of the factors in regional
success.


#### Free education of high quality


Children's success in life must not be dependant of their parents' economical
position. Basic education must be of high quality and multiculturalism must be
seen in schools. School well-being must be improved by decreasing class sizes,
by increasing practical and arts subjects and by developing morning and
afternoon activities as well as extra-curricular activities. Children are to be
allowed to remain children and we must refrain from subjecting education to an
over focus on efficiency.


#### Study allowance must be increased


Education and skills are Finland's advantages in global competition. Study
allowance must be increased in order to let students focus on their main
activity studying. Tuition fees would create both inequality and be a step in
the wrong direction, if we wish to persuade more international students to study
in Finland. The amount of teaching must not be decreased or the quality of
education weakened in the name of productivity. Academic freedom has an
intrinsic value, and it cannot be restrained. Fast and narrow degrees are an
advantage to neither students nor employers. The Greens want to maintain
academic freedom: students and researchers must have to the right to focus on
fields and subjects of their own choice, even if their choices seem
insignificant in the point of view of economic growth. Public funding of
universities must be secured.


#### The Greens want


* to remove the wage gap between men and women and to facilitate life for families with children by raising the lowest parental allowance, child allowances and maintenance allowance
* to guarantee all-female couples and all-male couples the right to adopt and marry
* to increase labour market support and thus decrease the need for subsidy
* to improve basic security of the poorest pensioners by increasing national pensions
* to improve pension support of family care givers thus that, in a case of divorce, the pension support from the time of giving care is divided equally between the spouses
* to decrease alcohol-related harms by raising taxes on spirits
* to promote the rights of the seriously disabled to personal assistants
* to secure the earliest possible entry to mental rehabilitation care for patients
* to guarantee family care givers equal opportunity to work in the entire country by transferring the payment of allowances from municipalities to Kela, The Social Insurance Institution of Finland
* to secure production of services by civic organizations by giving municipalities the chance to favour NGOs and the services they provide when putting municipal services out to tender.
* to guarantee the operational preconditions of NGOs and their voluntary work
* to remove entrance fees from state museums
* to increase language training received by immigrants
* to secure the functioning of libraries as a local service
* to improve the quality of education by increasing the financing of basic education and upper secondary education
* to raise student allowance
* to secure public funding for higher education.


### Economy Must Support Welfare, Employment and Equality


*For the Greens, economy is a tool which should be used to improve quality of
life and to promote sustainable development. Green competitiveness is based on
service innovations, environment and energy technologies and helping small
enterprises to flourish. Working must be made worthwhile at all times and wages
must be at an appropriate level. The social security of short-term employees
must be brought in line with long-term employees. Men and women must be
guaranteed equal rights to work and have a family life.*


#### Finland for leading country in environment and energy technology


Finland should be active in aiming to become the fore-runner in environment and
energy technology. We have all the prerequisites to claim our share from the
fast growing global environment and energy technology markets and promote the
spread of eco-inventions at the same time. In a global world success requires
strong commitment to education and research and the courage to favour
sustainable innovations in domestic markets


#### Prosperity and jobs with renewable energy sources


By supporting renewable energy sources we can create tens of thousands of new
jobs for Finland. By promoting the implementation of field and forest energies
we can create badly needed jobs and vitality for rural areas. By subsidizing
domestic wind power industry we strengthen our chances of success in future
markets.


#### Creativity breeds growth


The increasing free-time, urbanization and the rising educational level have all
made the culture sector the growing industry of the future. Creativity must
become the foundation of Finnish economic growth. In a global world those who
succeed are those who are able to create an open atmosphere for creativity and
new innovations.


In a functioning economy businesses accept their share of the social
responsibility. In the future this will be a genuine competition advantage.
Responsible competitiveness includes caring for your living environment.


#### Conditions of small businesses must be improved


Small businesses employing few people must be treated differently than large
industrial enterprises. Small business entrepreneurs must have their own
legislation to reduce useless bureaucracy. The work related well-being of
entrepreneurs must be improved by enabling them to hire employees. Small
business entrepreneurs, especially female entrepreneurs, must be enabled to join
working life and family life together by developing our social legislation.


#### Disabled people into the workforce


To exclude disabled people from working life is both economically and humanely
unwise. The first step to correcting this is to raise the educational level of
disabled people. Disabled people willing to work can be introduced into the
workforce by reducing obstructions from workplaces, by increasing interpreter,
assistant and rehabilitation services and by improving the flexibility of social
security and working hours.


#### The shadow economy must be curtailed


We must fight the shadow economy persistently. Shadow economy hurts both
businesses dealing fairly and employees who are treated poorly. The state is
also suffering as it is losing tax revenues.


#### Versatile employment policies


Employment cannot be improved by relying merely on import sectors or high
technological competence. To reduce unemployment and to support the welfare
state we need jobs that do not require high levels of training or aptitude. By
improving services we are creating jobs for ordinary people. At the same time we
are supporting domestic work, which cannot be relocated. The same applies to
local food. By promoting the usage of local food we support local employment,
reduce transportation and increase the safety of food.


Consumption must be directed away from goods to services to reduce the
environmental damages caused by economic growth. We can reduce taxes on work if
we secure the financing of services by increasing environmental taxes. The green
tax reformation 'kills two birds with one stone': it makes employing easier and
reduces environmental impact. Tax cuts must primarily benefit people with low
incomes.


#### Reforming basic security by basic income


Social security needs radical reform. We must enable employees to combine work
with social security. In addition, the same social security must be afforded to
those in short-term employment as to those in long-term employment. Basic income
offers basic security to everybody. It is clearer and fairer than the current
system and it makes financial planning easier for people in temporary work. It
also removes completely the humiliation added to social bureaucracy and
encourages working.


#### Working must always be worthwhile


Basic income benefits everybody because it makes working always worthwhile and
removes incentive traps. Basic income improves social security especially for
entrepreneurs, artists, parents staying at home and people who are in atypical
employment. This way it would support the birth of entrepreneurial and creative
economy emphasizing culture and services and enable people to make choices
according to their life situation.


#### Equality in working life must be improved


Equality in working life must be improved. Women's wages differ from men's wages
in the same industry and it is more difficult for a woman to enter the leading
positions in public sector or businesses than for men. Municipalities and state
must lead the way in removing wage differences between the sexes. The glass roof
must be broken. We must enable women to get into leading positions by using, for
example, the quota system. Workforce equality must also apply to disabled people
and immigrants.


#### Equal costs for parenthood


The discrimination of young women in labour market must end. The costs of
raising a family must be divided genuinely between all employers. At the same
time we must encourage fathers to participate more in the family life than they
currently do. Equality benefits everybody in the end. Young women will fare
better in the labour market and men will be allowed more room for being a
parent.


Society must adapt, so that parent may spend time with their children. It is not
right that employment is temporary when the need for the employee is permanent.
Unjustified temporary employment must cease. State and the municipalities must
at last pull themselves together and establish the positions of most of their
temporary employees.


#### More time


People must have sufficient time to rest and to relax and to do things that they
find meaningful. Only when they have rested are people capable of enjoying life
and being creative and efficient. Work must be flexible: more and more people
must have the possibility to do shorter working weeks, share their work or to
have job-alternation leave. You must be able to change money for free time.


#### *The Greens want*


* to strengthen the competitiveness of Finnish businesses by subsidizing the development and research of environmental and energy technologies
* to promote the demand for renewable energy sources by introducing feed-in tariffs, i.e. the price subsidised procurement obligations
* to support people living in detached houses in transferring to sustainable energy solutions like ground source heat and different wood heating options
* to create jobs in rural areas by transforming fallow land into fields producing energy crops
* to promote small business entrepreneurship by creating its own, separate legislation
* to create new jobs by reducing the social security costs for first hired employee
* to develop new forms of sabbaticals and study leaves for people in the workforce
* to improve small business entrepreneurs' chances to combine work with family life by reviewing legislation
* to favour close and organic food in public procurements
* to reduce the harms caused by economic growth by moving the emphasis from taxing work to taxing environmental harm
* to reduce income disparities by directing tax cuts to people with low incomes
* to reform social security and to promote working by creating a basic income
* to reduce the wage differences between the sexes by improving the opportunities of shop stewards to intervene in wage discrimination
* to end the discrimination of young women in the labour market by sharing the costs of parenthood equally between all employers
* to designate fathers with a larger share of the current parental leaves
* to reduce the unjustified use of temporary employment, for example, by giving the trade unions better chances at intervening in unjustified usage of temporary employment.


### Nature's Voice Must Be Heard - Man's Well-being is Dependant on Environment


*Climate change must be stopped and the Baltic Sea Saved. We must not rob
diverse nature from the future generations, and animals should be treated
ethically. Old forests, unpolluted air and clean water are riches that we have
to work for.*


#### Climate change must be stopped


Climate change is the biggest threat to humanity's well-being. By determined
policies we can restrain global warming to two degrees. This is why we must
halve all global climate emissions by 2050s. All the biggest polluters must be
included. The time frame in responsible climate policies is not electoral period
rather than centuries.


In Finland the goal must be to cut all emissions to a fifth of the current rate
by 2050. The portion of domestic, renewable energy out of the overall energy
consumption must be doubled within 20 years. We can accomplish that with an
ambitious but realistic climate policy.


#### Emission trade must be developed


In principle, emission trade is an efficient way of reducing emissions. But
there have been some serious mistakes made in implementing it. The profits made
by energy corporations have increased, but little has been done to invest those
profits into renewable energy sources. Competition in the electricity market is
not functioning as it should, which raises electricity prices. The emission
rights should be auctioned and unjustified profits made by electricity companies
must be taxed and the revenues should be directed into the introduction of
renewable energy sources.


#### To safe energy policies


Price of oil is increasing inevitably and the competition for energy is becoming
more intense. We must reinforce our energy self-sufficiency and draw a plan to
free ourselves from oil dependency. The consumption of energy continues to
increase in Finland, unlike in Sweden and Denmark, for example. Making energy
usage more efficient and conserving energy must become our primary goals. We can
become more efficient by creating energy norms for constructing, by informing
and by financial incentives. When we invest enough on making energy consumption
more efficient and on renewable energy forms, we do not have the need for more
nuclear power - neither domestic or as a Russian import. We do not want any
uranium mines in Finland nor additional nuclear waste. People should be able to
trust that their opinions count and that their homes are safe to live in and
will remain so in the future.


#### Transport dependency must be reduced


We must reduce the dependency on commuting by sound community planning and by
promoting remote work.


We must offer attractive alternatives for private car usage in cities as well as
in rural areas. In green Finland more people have the option of choosing whether
to go and do their grocery shopping by foot or by bicycle, or whether to use
train or a car on their way to work. In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area at least
we must introduce rush hour charges. At the same time we must create attractive
alternatives for driving. This means we have to develop public transportation
ambitiously: new routes, more bus departures and unobstructed means of
transportation.


Green traffic policies reduce our dependency on oil. We have to scale car
taxation strictly on emission basis. This way we encourage people to choose low
emission vehicles. The benefit shows itself in consumers' own economy as reduced
fuel costs. At the same time we must accelerate the introduction of biofuels.


#### Towards more eco-efficient society


In utilizing waste, the primary concern is the decreasing of waste generation
and then recycling. Utilizing waste as an energy source is justifiable if the
waste would otherwise end up at a waste disposal site. We cannot accept mass
burning of bagged waste. It does not fit the Finnish energy system because it is
a threat to more efficient co-production of electricity and heat.


With the help of new technology and economical guidance we can significantly
increase the ecoefficiency of our society. This enables us to create more
prosperity with less emissions, waste and energy consumption. Choosing the green
alternative in everyday life must be made nice and easy - and cheap.


#### More money for nature conservation


There are about thousand endangered species living in Finnish forests. The
forests and marshes of Southern Finland need a conservation programme of their
own to secure biodiversity. At the same time we must secure financing for
voluntary conservation of privately owned forests. Forestry and using forests
for recreational purposes must be developed to take nature into better
consideration. Great predator population in the whole of Finland must be on a
sustainable level. Regional concentrations of great predators must be avoided.
Damages caused by great predators must be compensated in full. In addition to
diversity of species, we must also look after the well-being of individual
animals. All animals must be guaranteed an opportunity for species-specific
behaviour, even in industrial surroundings. Organic animal husbandry must be
increased and subsidized financially. We must also take more steps towards more
biodynamic animal production even in ordinary production where the well-being of
animals is threatened by pursuit of smaller production costs.


#### Emergency help for the Baltic Sea


The alarming state of the Baltic Sea requires prompt actions. Finland must
especially reduce farming, fishing industry and traffic emissions. Together with
the other Baltic Sea States we have to decrease the risk of oil spills, support
the purifying of sewage in Russia and reduce the farming emissions. You must be
able to swim in the Baltic Sea without fearing for poisonous algae.


#### *The Greens want*


* to free Finland from oil dependency by the year 2030
* to pass legislation on conserving energy and to halve the energy needs in new constructions
* to direct the profits from emission trade to developing renewable energy sources
* to renew the outdated mining legislation and to secure people's opportunities to have an effect on their surroundings
* to encourage the choosing of low emission vehicles by scaling taxes on cars by emissions and by removing the tax on diesel
* to introduce rush hour charges in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area
* to improve public transportation by increasing significantly the financing of public transportation and rail projects
* to reduce waste generation by establishing a service centre for matter efficiency and by taxing waste burning and private waste disposal sites
* to direct the utilizing of waste into energy thus that it does not threaten the co-production of electricity and heat, and that it encourages waste reduction
* to draw up a conservation plan for forests and marshes of South Finland and to secure the financing of voluntary forest conservation
* to remove excess share on damages caused by great predators
* to replace the most problematic forms of production from the point of view of animal well-being such as the current efficient poultry farming with ethically sustainable production methods
* to decrease the pollutant loads on the Baltic Sea by improving the environmental directing of farming subsidies.


### Fair Globalization - Justice Breeds Security


*Mankind is wealthier than ever. We have the means and the finances to feed and
educate every children of the world. Globalization must become fairer and global
decisions must be made more democratically. To increase security means to
eradicate poverty, respecting human rights and emphasizing the prevention of
conflicts beforehand. Multiculturalism is a fortune even for native Finns.*


#### Education for all the children of the world


Mankind has the means to educate every children in the world, to give
information about contraception to all those who need it, and to eradicate
extreme poverty from the world. We in Finland can afford to raise our
development aid to the level proposed by the United Nations. Development
cooperation is, however, not enough. We have to transform the structures of
global trade to become fairer. The poorer countries must have the possibility of
offering their own products in the global market. We must make international
financing institutions more democratic by strengthening the conditions with
which the developing countries can participate in negotiations as equal
partners.


#### We need common rules


The European Union must be developed in such a way that it can better face the
challenges of globalization. We need a stronger Union to defend prosperity and
environment - and less interfering by the Union in matters which are better
suited for national or regional levels. The EU must promote the creation of
internationally bounding rules for states and corporations.


The many threatening scenarios such as environmental catastrophes, the threat of
terrorism or the collapsing states cannot be confronted with military alliances.
We do not need NATO membership to certify our security. Instead, we need
cooperation to prevent the scenarios from realising. We must improve UN's
chances to interfere in global security threats.


#### Security as a whole


The European Union has a wide array of tools for preventing conflicts.
Expansion, diplomacy, development aid, civilian crisis management and military
crisis management are all means of preventing crisis before they occur. As a
member of the Union, Finland must actively seek to affect the way the Union
practices security policies. Security must be understood in a wide sense so that
it encompasses, for example, environmental threats, and civilian crisis
management must be emphasized more than we currently do. Women must also join
the building of peace after conflicts; you cannot build a lasting peace without
the other half of mankind. We must defend human rights tirelessly and
courageously, and countering terrorism should not mean trampling on human
rights.


#### To selective national service


Participating in the Union's common security policies reinforces Finland's own
security. We in Finland can follow the footsteps of other EU nations and proceed
gradually to selective national service. At the same time we can reform the
national service to better correspond to new threats. Non-military service must
become shorter than it now is. As a member of the Union, Finland is bound to
support the EU's common goals and interests. Finnish democracy must, however, be
responsible for all defence and security policy related issues also in the
future.


#### Nuclear proliferation must be stopped


The peaceful use of nuclear power and nuclear proliferation are closely
connected. Finland must actively support the realisation and monitoring of the
Nuclear Proliferation Treaty. As the use of civilian nuclear power spreads, the
risk of nuclear weapons ending up with terrorists increases. For that reason
alone, we must decrease the usage of nuclear power. We must also be able to
control the illegal arms trade and proliferation of small arms more efficiently
than today.


#### More humane immigration policies


Finland must reform its immigration policies. Immigration policies are not
security policies. Essentially, immigration policies include employment issues
and family policies as well as development cooperation. The treatment of asylum
seekers must become more humane and authority procedures must become more
transparent. The position of victims of human trafficking must be improved.
Immigrating for working or studying must be made easier. You can get started in
working life even if you do not know all the noun inflexions yet.


Immigrants enrich our culture. They must also have the right to maintain and
develop their own culture. We need better ability to face diversity in ourselves
as in others. In Finland everybody must follow the laws and the rules of the
land. Human rights and equality cannot be trampled on by pleading to culture.


#### Global environmental organization


Solving international environmental problems requires cooperation between all
states. Global environmental policies need stronger leaders. There must be an
international environmental organization established under the UN.


#### *The Greens want*


* to raise Finland's development aid to 0.7 percent, as the UN suggests, by year 2010
* to create new financing systems, such as the international flight tax, for funding development aid
* to remove import subsidies which are harmful for the poorest of the developing countries
* to increase transparency in the EU and to reduce bureaucracy
* to advocate in the EU for minimum levels for corporate, environmental and capital taxes
* to establish a security committee for the Finnish Parliament to monitor general security
* to act to reform and reinforce the UN's system
* to make international financing institutions more democratic by supporting the participation of developing countries in negotiations
* to proceed to selective national service and to develop the contents of the national service
* to end imprisoning conscientious objectors who refuse from non-military for their opinions
* to reduce the number of b-permits granted to asylum seekers and instead grant them permanent asylum, and to make the position of those who have received their permits equitable
* to improve the position of victims of human trafficking by prolonging their permits of residence
* to facilitate immigration for working and studying, for example, by improving the chances of foreigners to seek for jobs and to get a working permits within Finland,
* to establish a global environmental organization under the UN to promote international environmental policies
